Bit No.	Parameter Name	Bit Comb.	Band QA
"0―1"	MODLAND QA bits	00	corrected product produced at ideal quality -- all bands
		01	corrected product produced at less than ideal quality -- some or all bands
		10	corrected product not produced due to cloud effects -- all bands
		11	"corrected product not produced for other reasons -- some or
all bands, may be fill value (11) [Note that a value of (11)
overrides a value of (01)]."
"2―5"	"band 1 data quality, four bit range"	0000	highest quality
		0111	noisy detector
		1000	"dead detector, data interpolated in L1B"
		1001	solar zenith >= 86 degrees
		1010	solar zenith >= 85 and < 86 degrees
		1011	missing input
		1100	"internal constant used in place of climatological data for at
least one atmospheric constant"
		1101	"correction out of bounds, pixel constrained to extreme allowable
value"
		1110	L1B data faulty
		1111	not processed due to deep ocean or clouds
